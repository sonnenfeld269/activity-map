# Activity Map

## Technologies, Frameworks, Libraries
* react
* react-map-gl or react-leaflet

## Tutorials, Documentation
<https://www.mapbox.com/help/#guides-to-getting-started>

## Implementation

![concept](/doc/concept.jpg)

### react-leaflet vs react-map-gl

#### Leaflet
* doesnâ€™t support vector tiles out of the box, need to use vector-grid plugin
* vector-grid cannot (yet) handle vector tile GL styles, need to manually integrate all styles from mapbox

#### Map-GL
* supports vector tiles
* can use simple style url for integrating styles
works great with openmaptiles (another free open source vector tiles provider)
